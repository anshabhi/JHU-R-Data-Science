This Data Science with R specialization is an introductory level 10-course specialization offered by renowned professors from the Johns Hopkins University. This specialization teaches one the fundamental concepts and techniques to provide the perfect platform for getting started with Data Science.

### Built With

I learned and made use of the following R packages in this specialization:

* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
* [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html)
* [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/)
* [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Capstone Project

  </a>

The Capstone Project was building a next word prediction app using a commerical dataset provided by SwiftKey. 

The app is available with live demo at the above URL. This is a R Shiny app.

The Capstone Presentation contains more details about the how the model works. This presentation was made using R Markdown.
